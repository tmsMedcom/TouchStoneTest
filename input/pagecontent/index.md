#### Quality Assurance Report

> Describe the errors

In the Quality Assurance report (QA-report) for this IG there are some errors and warnings. An instance of the errors are: *Unable to resolve resource with reference '/FHIRSandbox/MedCom/HospitalNotificationTMS/HospitalNotification-fixture-SLOR.xml* and *Unable to resolve resource with reference 'http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/hospitalnotification/StructureDefinition/medcom-hospitalNotification-message'*. The errors occur when creating a test script, as the fixture and profile are not reachable in the IG. However, they are reachable from TouchStone, why it is of less concern. For vendors who uses the test scripts locally should be aware of the error and e.g. create the fixtures and define the profile locally.
